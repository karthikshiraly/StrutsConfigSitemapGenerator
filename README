A Java based console app to generate Sitemap protocol (http://www.sitemaps.org/protocol.html)
compliant sitemap XML file from a Struts 1.x struts-config.xml file.

What problem does it solve?
---------------------------
Java web apps based on Struts 1.x already define their URL paths in struts-config.xml.
A sitemap generator like this saves developers the effort to write another XML - the sitemap XML
file - which will have most of the same URL paths, but in a different XML schema.
Developer can specify an exclusion list, to prevent some paths from being included in the sitemap
XML.
The generated sitemap XML files can then be submitted to Google or Bing manually or automatically,
using their webmaster tools.
